# Frontend Nanodegree Arcade Game

## How to get started

Just loadup the index.html in a browser.

## Requirements

You will need a browser that supports **HTML5 Canvas** such as **chrome** or other modern browsers.

## Controls and #Winning!
Use the arrow keys for movement, and try to avoid the bugs. You win be reaching to water at the top of the level.

## License

I reserve no license to this game, as it is built upon the corresponding **Udacity frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game**.  

## Further development

I might consider making a multiplayer version of the game, and make it run on Google Chromecast, using their gamemanager api. I have a working version, and will be updating the project with it soon.

## Contributions

This software was a short demonstration of what you can do with **HTML5 Canvas** and **Object Oriented JavaScript** as such, I will not be taking contributions. you could however maybe contribute to the original [Udacity project frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game ](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game).
